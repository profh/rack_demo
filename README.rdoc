This is the code for a simple demo of rack given in the morning section of 67-272 (S12).  Earliest versions of the code run a very simple rack app and the code evolves over time so that students see how rack can be used to create middleware and even simple web frameworks.  

The demo is not yet complete in class so there will be more to come.
